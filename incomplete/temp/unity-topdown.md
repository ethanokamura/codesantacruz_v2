In this section, we will create a basic top down shooter game. This is purely a starting point. The game will not be fully completed, but acts as a solid foundation for a game.

## What this course covers:
1. Player Movement
2. Mouse Interaction
3. Shooting Functionality
4. Basic Enemy AI

## Our Unity Courses:
In all of our current Unity courses offered by { config.title }, we will be only be creating 2D projects. I firmly believe that working in a 2D environment is most beneficial and effective for new developers. In my experience, this section seems to be the students' favorite topic due to its interactive nature and immediate results. Game design empowers students to express themselves through programming, graphic design, and sound design, creating a highly engaging learning experience. Unity's exceptional error report system facilitates the identification and resolution of errors, enabling students to learn from their mistakes and refine their games. Unity allows for the conversion of games to WebGL, which facilitates the embedding of games in websites. This opens the door to exploring topics such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, creating a seamless transition to web development.
## Prerequisites:
It is important that you have a basic understanding of Unity's layout and interface. If not, I highly recommend completing the Unity 101 course we offer to learn how to navigate the Unity Editor and set up your first project! This course assume that you have prior experience in programming. If not, I highly recommend checking out our C++ 101 course that teaches you everything you need to learn about programming. C++, the language used in that course, has a similar syntax to that of C#, the language Unity uses in its scripting.
<!-- ## Necessary Files:
For this game, we will be starting with a barebones 2D core project offered in the Unity Hub. I have attached an optional file containing premade sprites for the character, enemy, and tiles! If you prefer to use your own artwork, that is perfectly acceptable and encouraged. -->
