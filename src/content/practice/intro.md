Using your knowledge of programming, try to complete as many of these problems as you can! I urge you to review my C++ course if you get stuck. These problems will push you to think outside the box and familiarize yourself with the syntax of your language of choice as well as basic programming concepts.

The problems get increasingly more challenging as you go down the list and build on previous topics. If you get stuck or need to test your code, refer to the solutions page!

Good luck and have fun!
