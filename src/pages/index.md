## CodeSantaCruz
Welcome to CodeSantaCruz, where we aim to empower students in their programming journey. We will set students up for success by engaging in detailed programming projects ranging from a beginning to an advanced level. We push our students to think outside the box by offering a supportive environment to explore coding as a healthy outlet for creativity. Our comprehensive curriculum teaches programming concepts and delves into real-world applications and general computer science topics. To ensure accessibility, we try to use free software programs, except for artistic tools like Aesprite or Photoshop. Join us at CodeSantaCruz to unlock your potential in the exciting world of software development and embark on a transformative, educational journey.

## About Me
A little about me, my name is Ethan Okamura, I am a computer science major with an end goal of receiving a master's degree alongside practical experience in software engineering. As the creator of CodeSantaCruz, I aim to be a mentor and teacher, providing affordable resources for people of all backgrounds. With a decade of programming expertise and a background in teaching, my goal is to instill a love for programming in anyone who wants to take these courses while they have fun creating their dream projects. I am committed to the continuous journey of learning and higher education and strive to offer my students comprehensive knowledge and support.

## End Goal
My goal with these lessons and courses is to offer a personalized learning experience. When I was young, I taught myself how to program, but took lots of the wrong steps and skipped over important topics. Now that I am older, more experienced, and have succeeded in structured college courses within this field, I am prepared to share my experiences and knowledge with others to help them learn to code both efficiently and effectively. With two years of teaching experience, I have worked with students of all ages and walks of life. I am prepared to work with anyone who has an interest in programming or wants to express themselves creatively. I believe programming is such a healthy, beneficial, and practical hobby.

When it comes to my teaching style, I strongly believe in learning by doing. My entire life, I have been a very hands-on learner. I find this works best for me, as well as with many other creatively inclined individuals (as with younger students). Personally, I struggle with long, drawn-out lectures. To remedy this, I offer project-based courses where the student will learn a topic and immediately practice it. Through repetition and practice, the students will quickly learn everything they need to know to be successful in the future. I hope to inspire students to continue this path even after they are done working with me!

## Teaching Style
I recommend that all new programmers follow the curriculum path I have set up. To start, I like to cover an introduction to programming via C++ and work our way into game development with C# and Unity (a game engine). Finally, when we complete our first game, I move to web design, so students can have a platform to host their games. This way, friends and families can see their progress remotely! By progressing through these three steps, students will acquire a comprehensive skill set in software development. Starting with the fundamentals of programming in C++, transitioning to game development with Unity and C#, and culminating in web development with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, our online teaching service offers a seamless and rewarding learning journey.

## 01: Introduction to Programming with C++
In this first step of our online teaching service, we provide students with a solid foundation in programming through an introductory course in C++. C++ is a widely used language that is applicable to most programs and is highly sought after in the job market. Despite its initial reputation as a daunting language, when taught effectively, it can lead to excellent long-term results. During this step, I draw on my experiences in college with C++ to guide students through the basics of general programming using C++. By acquiring fundamental knowledge of variables and algorithms in C++, students can seamlessly transition into game design, specifically utilizing the Unity engine.

Throughout our time together, I assign challenge problems with C++ for students to work on outside the lessons, allowing them to practice and reinforce their programming skills.

## 02: Game Development with C# and Unity
Building upon the student's understanding of C++ from Step 1, we delve into the exciting world of game development using C# in conjunction with the Unity game engine. As the instructor, this section is my favorite due to its interactive nature and immediate results.

Game design empowers students to express themselves through programming, graphic design, and sound design, creating a highly engaging learning experience. Unity's exceptional error report system facilitates the identification and resolution of errors, enabling students to learn from their mistakes and refine their games.

This step represents the most intensive part of the lessons, as we dedicate ample time to exploring Unity and C# concepts. Furthermore, Unity allows for the conversion of games to WebGL, which facilitates the embedding of games in websites. This opens the door to exploring topics such as JavaScript, CSS, and HTML, creating a seamless transition to web development.

## 03: Web Development with JavaScript/HTML/CSS
In the final step of our online teaching service, we guide students through the realm of web development, focusing on JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Students will actively work on creating and enhancing their own websites, including a dedicated page where they can showcase their games and overall progress.

By using HTML and CSS, students will learn to create visually appealing and interactive web pages. JavaScript further enriches the web development experience by enabling students to make their websites more dynamic and responsive.  

This step serves as an excellent opportunity for students to demonstrate their accomplishments to both their peers and parents through the personalized pages they design and create. Additionally, it equips students with essential skills in creating modern-day web applications and websites, as JavaScript is a sought-after programming language for software engineers.
